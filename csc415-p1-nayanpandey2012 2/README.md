## Student Name : Nayan Pandey

## Student ID   : 920065390

## Build Instructions

In order to build the program, I need to open a Terminal and download the brew.sh and make git compatible in the Terminal. Then, after coding the hello_world.c as per Professor, I saved it and type the the ./a.out, which displays the executed program output in Terminal.


## Run Instructions

In order to run the program, type "./a.out" to execute the program. Then, I noticed the output "CSC415, This program written by Nayan Pandey!". 

## Program Does

At first, this program reads and formats the String "CSC415, This program written by Nayan Pandey!" into a buffer by using sprintf() function, then, the program outputs the String "CSC415, This program written by Nayan Pandey!" from the buffer we created by using write() function.
